      {
        heading: "A conversation about change",
        body: "Motivational Interviewing is a way of talking with someone about change that draws out their own reasons, rather than handing them yours. It was developed in healthcare, and it works in leadership too.",
      },
      {
        heading: "People argue for what they hear themselves say",
        body: "When you make the case for change, the other person tends to make the case against it. When they make the case themselves, they're more likely to act on it.",
        example: "\"You need to get these reports in on time\" often gets \"I would if the data were ready.\" \"What would getting them in on time do for you?\" gets a different answer.",
      },
      {
        heading: "The righting reflex",
        body: "Most leaders feel a strong pull to fix, correct, or advise. It comes from caring. In change conversations it usually backfires, because it puts them on the other side of the argument.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Guiding, not directing or following",
        body: "Directing tells people what to do. Following just goes along. Guiding sits in between: you bring direction and expertise, and they bring knowledge of their own life and work.",
        example: "Like a good hiking guide, you know the terrain. They decide where they want to go.",
      },
      {
        heading: "MI isn't a trick",
        body: "MI isn't a way to get people to do what you want. If you're using it to manipulate, people can tell, and it stops working. It's for helping someone find their own reasons.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Practice is the point",
        body: "MI is simple to describe and hard to do under pressure. Short, regular practice builds the habits you'll reach for in real conversations.",
      },

    title: "OARS: four core skills",
    cards: [
      {
        heading: "Open questions",
        body: "Open questions invite a story instead of a yes or no. They usually start with what, how, or tell me.",
        example: "Closed: \"Is the new schedule working?\" Open: \"How's the new schedule been for you?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Affirmations",
        body: "An affirmation names a real strength, effort, or value you see in the person. It's specific and about them, not about your approval.",
        example: "\"You stayed late to make sure the handoff was clean. You really look out for your team.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflections",
        body: "A reflection is a statement, not a question, that says back what you heard. Simple reflections stay close to their words. Complex reflections add meaning or name what's underneath.",
        example: "They say: \"I'm buried in tickets.\" Simple: \"You're buried.\" Complex: \"You're carrying more than one person can keep up with.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Summaries",
        body: "A summary pulls together several things they've said, so they can hear their own story. It's a good way to check understanding or move the conversation forward.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflect more than you ask",
        body: "A useful habit: aim for about two reflections for every question. Questions gather facts. Reflections show you understood, and they often get you more than another question would.",

  // Unit 2: Spirit of MI

    cards: [
      {
        heading: "Skills without spirit fall flat",
        body: "You can ask open questions and still come across as interrogating. The spirit of MI is the mindset that makes the skills work. It has four parts: partnership, acceptance, compassion, and evocation.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Partnership",
        body: "You're working with them, not on them. You have expertise and a role to play. They're the expert on their own work, life, and motivations.",
        example: "\"You know this workflow better than anyone. I'd like to figure this out with you.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Acceptance",
        body: "Acceptance means respecting their worth, trying to see things from their side, honoring their right to choose, and noticing their strengths. It doesn't mean you approve of everything they do.",
        example: "You can accept that someone is frustrated with a policy and still expect them to follow it.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Compassion",
        body: "Keep their wellbeing in view. As a leader you have goals for the team, and you also care what happens to this person.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Evocation",
        body: "Assume they already have reasons and ideas for change. Your job is to draw those out, not to install new ones.",
        example: "\"What would you like to be different about how month-end goes?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Autonomy is real, even at work",
        body: "Some expectations aren't up for debate. People still choose how they respond. Saying that out loud often lowers defensiveness.",
        example: "\"The deadline is firm. How you get there is your call.\"",

  // Unit 3: Engaging
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    cards: [
      {
        heading: "Trust comes first",
        body: "Engaging is the process of building enough trust and connection that a real conversation can happen. Without it, everything else stalls.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Lead with curiosity",
        body: "Start by understanding their view before sharing yours. People are more open to your agenda once they feel you've heard theirs.",
        example: "\"Before we get into anything, how have things been going for you lately?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflect the feeling under the complaint",
        body: "Complaints often carry a feeling: frustration, worry, feeling unseen. Reflecting that feeling tells them you're listening for more than the facts.",
        example: "They say: \"I've submitted nine tickets.\" You reflect: \"You've been doing what you were asked, and it feels like no one's listening.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Watch for disengagement traps",
        body: "Common traps: asking question after question, jumping to fixes, labeling the problem, or rushing to your topic. Each one can make people go quiet.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Your role adds weight",
        body: "As their manager, a request to talk can feel like a warning. Be honest about why you're meeting, and say so early if it isn't disciplinary.",
        example: "\"This isn't about a mistake. I've noticed you seem quieter, and I wanted to check in.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "How you'll know it's working",
        body: "Their answers get longer. They bring up things you didn't ask about. The pace slows down. These are signs they're engaging with you.",

  // Unit 4: Focusing
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    title: "Focusing: agreeing on what this is about",
    cards: [
      {
        heading: "A shared direction",
        body: "Focusing is finding and keeping a clear direction for the conversation, one you both agree on. Without it, conversations wander or turn into a lecture.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Three ways a focus shows up",
        body: "Sometimes the focus is clear from the start. Sometimes you need to choose from several options. Sometimes you need to explore before a focus emerges.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Ask permission to raise your topic",
        body: "When you have something to discuss, asking permission respects their autonomy and makes them more likely to listen.",
        example: "\"Would it be okay if we spent a few minutes on the chart notes?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Agenda mapping",
        body: "When there's a lot going on, lay the options out and let them choose where to start. You can add your own topic to the list.",
        example: "\"So there's staffing, the new metrics, the team conflict, and your reviews. Where would you like to start?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Ask, offer, ask",
        body: "When you need to share information, first ask what they know, then offer what's useful, then ask what they make of it. It keeps information from turning into a lecture.",
        example: "\"What have you heard about the new float policy?\" ... \"Here's how it works.\" ... \"How does that fit with what you expected?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Your agenda counts too",
        body: "Focusing isn't giving up your topic. As a leader, some things need to be discussed. The skill is raising them in a way that invites partnership.",

    title: "Hearing change talk",
    cards: [
      {
        heading: "Evoking draws out their reasons",
        body: "Once you have a focus, evoking is about helping them voice their own motivation for change. The words they use tell you how it's going.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Change talk",
        body: "Change talk is anything they say that leans toward change. It's easy to miss because it's often mixed in with reasons not to change.",
        example: "\"I don't love being the bottleneck.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Desire, ability, reasons, need",
        body: "Early change talk often sounds like wanting (\"I'd like to\"), being able (\"I could\"), reasons (\"It would help the team\"), or need (\"I have to\").",
        example: "Desire: \"I want to get back to where I was.\" Ability: \"I could block time on Fridays.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Commitment, activation, taking steps",
        body: "Later change talk is about doing: \"I will,\" \"I'm ready to,\" or \"I already started.\" This is often a sign they're getting ready to plan.",
        example: "\"I'm going to talk to finance about the template this week.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Sustain talk",
        body: "Sustain talk is the other side: reasons to keep things as they are. It's normal. Most people feel both ways. Arguing with it usually makes it stronger.",
        example: "\"Nobody reads those reports until the 10th anyway.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflect the change talk",
        body: "When you hear change talk, reflect it, ask for more, or affirm it. People tend to say more of what gets attention.",

      {
        heading: "Ask evocative questions",
        body: "Some questions naturally invite change talk: \"What would be better if this changed?\" \"How important is this to you, from 0 to 10?\" \"Why that number and not a lower one?\"",

        heading: "Don't argue the other side",
