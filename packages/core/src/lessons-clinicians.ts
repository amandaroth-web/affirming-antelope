      {
        heading: "A conversation about change",
        body: "Motivational Interviewing is a collaborative way of talking with patients about change. It draws out their own reasons instead of handing them yours. It was developed in healthcare and is now used for everything from medications to smoking to sleep.",
      },
      {
        heading: "People argue for what they hear themselves say",
        body: "When you make the case for change, patients tend to make the case against it. When they voice their own reasons, they're more likely to act on them.",
        example: "\"You need to take this every day\" often gets \"I feel fine without it.\" \"What, if anything, worries you about your blood pressure?\" gets a different answer.",
      },
      {
        heading: "The righting reflex",
        body: "Clinicians are trained to fix things. When you see a risk, the urge to correct it is strong, and it comes from caring. In change conversations it often backfires: the patient ends up defending the side you're arguing against.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Guiding, not directing or following",
        body: "Directing tells patients what to do. Following just goes along. Guiding sits in between: you bring clinical expertise, and they bring expertise on their own life, values, and what's realistic.",
        example: "You know the medicine. They know their mornings, their budget, and their family.",
      },
      {
        heading: "MI isn't a trick",
        body: "MI isn't a technique for getting patients to comply. If you use it to manipulate, people can tell, and it stops working. It's for helping someone find their own reasons, and the decision stays theirs.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Short visits count",
        body: "You don't need an hour. A few minutes of MI in a 15-minute visit can change how the rest of it goes. Short, regular practice builds the habits you'll reach for when the schedule is packed.",

        heading: "Open questions",
        body: "Open questions invite a story instead of a yes or no. They usually start with what, how, or tell me.",
        example: "Closed: \"Are you using your inhaler?\" Open: \"How has the inhaler been fitting into your days?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Affirmations",
        body: "An affirmation names a real strength, effort, or value you see in the patient. It's specific and about them, not about your approval.",
        example: "\"You came back after a rough first week of rehab. You're sticking with this.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflections",
        body: "A reflection is a statement, not a question, that says back what you heard. Simple reflections stay close to their words. Complex reflections add meaning or name what's underneath.",
        example: "They say: \"I can't keep track of all these pills.\" Simple: \"It's a lot of pills.\" Complex: \"Keeping up with them feels like a second job.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Summaries",
        body: "A summary pulls together several things the patient said, so they can hear their own story. It's useful before you change topics and at the end of a visit.",
        example: "\"So far: the pill made you foggy, you'd like to take fewer of them, and your dad's stroke is on your mind. Did I get that right?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Reflect more than you ask",
        body: "A useful habit: aim for about two reflections for every question. Questions gather facts. Reflections show you understood, and in a short visit they often get you to what matters faster than another question would.",

        heading: "Partnership",
        body: "You're working with the patient, not on them. You're the expert on the medicine. They're the expert on themselves.",

      },
      {
        heading: "Acceptance",
        body: "Acceptance means respecting their worth, trying to see things from their side, honoring their right to choose, and noticing their strengths. It doesn't mean you agree with every choice.",
        example: "You can accept that a patient isn't ready to quit smoking and still care a lot about their lungs.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Compassion",
        body: "Compassion means actively working for the patient's wellbeing, with their priorities at the center. It's about them, not about hitting a target or a quality measure.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Empowerment",
        body: "Help patients see and use their own strengths, ideas, and know-how. Assume they already have reasons and some sense of what could work. Earlier editions called this part evocation: drawing out, not putting in.",
        example: "\"What's worked for you before, even for a little while?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "The choice is theirs",

      {
        heading: "Start with their agenda",
        body: "Ask what they'd like to get out of the visit in the first minute. It often prevents the \"Oh, one more thing\" at the door.",

      },
      {
        heading: "One behavior at a time",

      {
        heading: "Quick moves that work",

        heading: "Lead with curiosity",
        body: "Start by understanding their view before sharing yours. Patients are more open to your concerns once they feel you've heard theirs.",

      },
      {
        heading: "Reflect the feeling under the complaint",
        body: "Complaints often carry a feeling: frustration, worry, feeling brushed off. Reflecting that feeling tells them you're listening for more than the facts.",
        example: "They say: \"I've called three times about this refill.\" You reflect: \"You've done everything you're supposed to, and it still feels like nobody's on your side.\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "Watch for disengagement traps",
        body: "Common traps: rapid-fire closed questions, fixing before understanding, labels like \"noncompliant,\" jumping to your topic, and looking for who's to blame. Each one can make patients go quiet.",
      },
      {
        heading: "The white coat adds weight",
        body: "Many patients expect to be judged before you say a word, especially about weight, drinking, or missed visits. Say what you're there for, and let them have a say in what gets discussed.",
        example: "\"I'm not here to lecture. What's on your mind today?\"",
      },
      {
        heading: "How you'll know it's working",

    cards: [
      {
        heading: "A shared direction",
        body: "Focusing is finding and keeping a direction for the conversation that you both agree on. With several problems and a clock running, it keeps a visit from trying to do everything and doing nothing well.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Three ways a focus shows up",
        body: "Sometimes the focus is clear from the start because they came in about it. Sometimes you choose together from several options. Sometimes you need to explore before a focus emerges.",

      },
      {
        heading: "Ask permission to raise your topic",
        body: "When you have a concern they didn't bring up, asking permission respects their autonomy and makes them more likely to listen.",

      },
      {
        heading: "Your agenda counts too",
        body: "Focusing isn't giving up your clinical priorities. A very high blood pressure or a positive screen still needs attention. The skill is raising it in a way that invites partnership and saying why it matters to you.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Park the rest, out loud",

        heading: "Change talk",
        body: "Change talk is anything the patient says that leans toward change. It's easy to miss because it's often tucked in among reasons not to change.",

        body: "Ask \"On a scale of 0 to 10, how important is this to you?\" Then ask why they're not lower: \"Why a 4 and not a 1?\" Their answer is change talk. Asking \"Why only a 4?\" gets the opposite. Confidence works the same way: \"What would help move it from a 6 to a 7?\"",
