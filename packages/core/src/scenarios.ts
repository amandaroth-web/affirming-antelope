    hiddenBackstory:
      "Lucia's mother moved in with her two months ago after a fall, and Lucia now handles her mom's evening medications and appointments. She leaves on time because she has to relieve her teenage son, who watches his grandmother after school. She's quiet in huddles because she's exhausted and because a new lead MA, Brianna, has started correcting her in front of others, which stings after three years of being the go-to person. She hasn't mentioned any of this because she doesn't want to seem like she can't handle things, and she's afraid asking for schedule flexibility would cost her the Saturday overtime she now needs. What she cares about: being seen as competent, her mom, and not being a burden. What would help her open up: a supervisor who notices her effort, doesn't rush to fix things, and makes it clear this isn't a disciplinary talk. If she feels safe, she'll mention her mom first, and only later (if asked with real curiosity) the friction with Brianna. If the learner reflects her well, by the end she may say something like \"I think I'd feel better if I didn't have to pretend everything's normal.\"",

      "Darnell was passed over for the senior analyst role six months ago. It went to an outside hire, Kyle, who now gets the interesting projects while Darnell is left with month-end reports. Nobody explained the decision to him. He's stopped going the extra mile because it didn't seem to matter. He also suspects the reporting template is broken: it requires manual reconciliation that takes two days, and he's flagged it twice without a response. Underneath the flatness, he's proud of his work and hates being seen as the bottleneck; the finance team used to rely on him and he misses that. He's quietly been updating his resume but doesn't really want to leave, since he likes the team and his commute. What would help him open up: a manager who acknowledges that something changed for him, asks about it with curiosity, and doesn't defend the promotion decision. If the learner reflects his frustration accurately, he'll eventually mention being passed over. If they reflect his pride or his dislike of being the bottleneck, he'll start offering change talk (\"I don't want to be that guy,\" \"I used to be the one they counted on\"). He will not commit to a detailed plan in this conversation, but may say he's willing to think about it or to talk about the template.",

Since then she's believed it's safer to do things herself. She grew up as the oldest of five and has always been 'the one who handles it.' She's proud of how well the clinic runs and fears that if she lets go, quality will slip and it'll be her fault. She's also more tired than she admits: she's had chest tightness a couple of times (she's been checked, it's stress), and her husband has started making pointed comments about her laptop at dinner. She genuinely likes her leads, Jamal and Tess, and knows Jamal has asked to take on supply orders and scheduling. What would help her open up: someone who affirms how much she carries and how well she does it, and who helps her look at her own goals rather than pushing 'delegate more.' Mentioning her missed vacation with curiosity (not as criticism) is a good opening. If the learner helps her pick one focus and evokes her values (her family, her health, developing her people), she'll start talking about Jamal and may float handing off one thing.

On the other hand, his team is stretched thin, registration errors are up, and he's tired of patients waiting at the counter while his staff answers phones. He'd actually like his team to spend more time helping people who need it. He takes pride in being the one who knows every regular by name. What would help: a manager who treats him as the expert on his patients, acknowledges the rollout is decided without pretending otherwise, and asks what would make it work. If asked directly and honestly about job security, he'll be relieved to hear it, but he won't raise it himself unless he feels safe. Once he feels heard, he'll start suggesting ideas: a 'kiosk helper' role, keeping one counter lane open, translated screens. He's ready to plan by the end if the learner evokes his reasons first.",

Underneath, he's protective of his nurses (several are new grads he's personally training) and scared that the new ratios will burn them out or put patients at risk. He's also tired: he's 58, thinking about retirement in a few years, and wants to leave the unit in good shape. What he might be open to: the added LPNs would genuinely help with med passes, and he knows it, though he won't say so early. He'd want a real say in how the model is implemented on nights. What would help: the learner acknowledging the memo was a bad way to find out (a brief, genuine apology), reflecting his protectiveness of his nurses, not defending leadership, and emphasizing that he has real influence over how this plays out on nights. He needs several accurate reflections before the sarcasm drops. Any defending, policy-quoting, or 'I understand, but' will send him back to discord.
